# Getting Started
I'm going to leave this as a static html page. Incorporating the JavaScript would not be overly difficult but I don't have the time right now (02/10/2024) due to personal medical issues (I have (minor) surgery scheduled in a couple of days).
This project was about CSS anyway with incorporating the JavaScript being the stretch goal.
